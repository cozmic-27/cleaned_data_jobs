# Cleaned_Data_Jobs

## Description
Libraries are imported and necessary info about the dataset is printed. The salary column’s non-numeric characters are then filtered out and it is divided into three separate columns (upper, lower and average).

Company column’s numbers and non-alphabetic characters are filtered out. Three new skill columns are added from extracted strings in the “Job Description” category. These include “Excel, Python and Machine Learning.”

Jobs with 2 years or less are extracted and sorted in ascending order with their index to the right. Underneath, a count of all the jobs containing “Bachelors, Masters and PHD” are listed and the total number of degrees required is displayed.
